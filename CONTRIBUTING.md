# Contributing to Xcento
We believe in making code comprehensible and clean. Most important ! we like our code to be uniform and properly documented. Thus, we came up with some things that need to be remembered while writing code for Xcento.

## Documentation
1. Add a doc string(comment) after every new function or class declaration. The doc string should be concise and convey the usage of the class

2. If a function is broken or needs to be rewritten then write it as a TODO comment for easier navigation in IDE.

3. No explanations needed in comments. Only simple comprehensive phrases.

4. All the features and associated explanation to be added in the /docs/en_doc.txt

## Code
1. Preferred variable naming style - Camel case

2. Single letters (only allowed for iterators) and underscores not preffered.

3. In issues, give specific detail of the issue so that it can be reproduced and fixed effectively

4. Any new feature or bug fix request to be tested well before commit

5. Commit only once after your work is done to the repository so that commit history is clean and merge issues can be avoided

6. Every new feature to be treated as a separate class file. A feature can have more than one class file but a class file can't have two features.

7. We prefer to use an encapsulated approach in the code so don't make every class public.

8. Keep the classes as loosely coupled as possible and try to follow OOP design.

9. Most important try to complete deadlines.
